# Customer Behavior and Audience Segmentation | E-Commerce Project Analysis

# E-Commerce Project Overview

This E-Commerce project analysis provides insightful data-driven answers to several key questions regarding user behavior, order delivery issues, product popularity by day of the week, user retention, and RFM segmentation for quality audience analysis. Using a robust set of Python libraries, this project dives deep into an e-commerce dataset to extract meaningful statistics and trends that can help in strategic decision-making.

## Key Questions Addressed

- **User Behavior:** How many users have made a purchase only once?
- **Order Delivery Issues:** Monthly average of undelivered orders detailed by reason.
- **Product Popularity:** Determination of the day of the week on which each product is most often purchased.
